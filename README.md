# Mobile Flashcards

This is an Udacity's React Developer course project submission where I used React Native and Redux to create an app where you can create multiple flashcard decks to review them later and help you reassure your knowledge in any subject. 

## Tests

The development version was tested on these devices:

* Samsung S10 plus
* Samsung S20
* iPad Pro
* iPhone 7

## Requirements

* node version 12.19.0 or higher
* A smartphone compatible with the Expo Go app
* Connection to internet

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, in order to install depedencies you can run:

### `npm install`

and

### `npm install -g expo expo-cli`

Then just run:

### `expo start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:19000](http://localhost:19000) to view the QR Code in the browser.\
Then, open the Expo Go app on your phone and scan the QR Code to view the app.
